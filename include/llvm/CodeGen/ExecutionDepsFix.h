/// it's execution domain or collect clearance information. However, for the
/// clearance calculation, we need to know clearances from all predecessors
/// (including any backedges), therfore we need to visit some blocks twice. 
/// As an example, consider the following loop.
/// 
/// 
///    PH -> A -> B (xmm<Undef> -> xmm<Def>) -> C -> D -> EXIT

/// Optimized: PH A B C A' B' C' D

/// Once we finish processing some block, we update the counters in MBBInfos
/// and re-process any successors that are now 'done'.
/// We call a block that is ready for its final round of processing `done`
/// (isBlockDone), e.g. when all predecessor information is known.
///
/// Note that a naive traversal order would be to do two complete passes over
/// all basic blocks/instructions, the first for recording clearances, the
/// second for updating clearance based on backedges.
/// However, for functions without backedges, or functions with a lot of
/// straight-line code, and a small loop, that would be a lot of unnecessary
/// work (since only the BBs that are part of the loop require two passes).
///
/// E.g., the naive iteration order for the above exmple is as follows:
/// Naive: PH A B C D A' B' C' D'
